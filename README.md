# Work Day Scheduler

For week 5, the challenge we were set up to do was to add javascript to the starter code  that would fill out the site with the hours of a typical working day. You would be able to write in the blocks of hours what you are doing, save it to your localstorage, and edit other blocks if you wrote in them prior.

Here is the link to the launched site.
